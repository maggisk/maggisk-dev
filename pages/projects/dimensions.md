2d simulation survival game made using lua and [love2d](https://love2d.org/)

I realized making this game that I don't like lua. The speed of lua-jit is extremely impressive, but the design of the language makes it un-fun (for me) for big projects.

The project is on hold until I find the inspiration and a more interesting game framework to continue development.

Graphics design by my 14 year old daughter :)
